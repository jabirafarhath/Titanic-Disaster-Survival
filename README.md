### What is Regression?

Regression is a type of analysis in machine learning in which we try to analyze the relationship between a dependent variables and independent variable(s).

1. Linear Regression --> answers us in the form of _How much_
2. Logistic Regression --> answers us in the form of _yes/no_

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical.
